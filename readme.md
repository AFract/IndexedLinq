i40 - Index for objects
=======================

i4o (index for objects) is the first class library that extends LINQ to allow you to put indexes on your objects. Using i4o, the speed of LINQ operations are often over one thousand times faster than without i4o.

### How to Build

You should be able to run either the build.Debug.bat or build.Release.bat. These will both run msbuild on the project and then run the Silverlight tests using [StatLight](http://statlight.codeplex.com) and the full framework tests with [NUnit](http://nunit.org)
