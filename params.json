{"name":"I4o","tagline":"Indexes for Objects","body":"IP.i4o - Index for objects\r\n=======================\r\n\r\nIP.i4o (index for objects) enhances the i4o library ([https://github.com/ericksoa/i4o](https://github.com/ericksoa/i4o) from which it was forked. This library was renamed as well in order to prevent confusion if, for example, both this and the original were to appear on NuGet.\r\n\r\n## Key Features\r\n\r\n* Allows indexes to be added to collections to optimize LINQ queries since, by default, LINQ queries collection items sequentially.\r\n\r\n## Enhancements/changes to i4o\r\n\r\n* Optimized inefficient index queries whereby the binary search was performed twice: first to check if the key existed and again to look up the key/value\r\n* Removed c5 collections dependency/source code (mainly the red-black tree implementation was used) in favor of the .NET built-in generic SortedList \r\n* Removed Silverlight projects -- this is mainly because I'm not developing anything for Silverlight at the moment and do not want to spend time maintaining it\r\n\r\n## How to Build\r\n\r\nTo be completed\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nGNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL)\r\nVersion 3.0, 29 June 2007","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
