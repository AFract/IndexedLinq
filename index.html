        <h1>IP.i4o - Index for objects</h1>

<p>IP.i4o (index for objects) enhances the i4o library (<a href="https://github.com/ericksoa/i4o">https://github.com/ericksoa/i4o</a>) from which it was forked. This library was renamed as well in order to prevent confusion if, for example, both this and the original were to appear on NuGet.</p>

<h2>Project</h2>

<h2>Key Features</h2>

<ul>
<li>Allows indexes to be added to collections to optimize LINQ queries since, by default, LINQ queries collection items sequentially. Specifically, this is achieved by adding either a comparison or an equality index, which have O(log n) or O(1) operation, respectively.
<pre>Standard (unoptimized) LINQ queries: <strong>O(n)</strong>
LINQ queries with comparison index: <strong>O(log n)</strong>
LINQ queries with equality index: <strong>O(1)</strong></pre>
</li>
</ul><h2>Enhancements/changes to i4o</h2>

<ul>
<li>Optimized inefficient index queries whereby the binary search was performed twice: first to check if the key existed and again to look up the key/value</li>
<li>Removed c5 collections dependency/source code (it was used by i40 primarily for its red-black tree implementation and helper methods for selecting ranges) in favor of the .NET built-in generic <code>SortedList&lt;TKey,TValue&gt;</code>.</li>
<li>Removed Silverlight projects -- this is mainly because I'm not developing anything for Silverlight at the moment and do not want to spend time maintaining it.</li>
</ul><h2>How to Build</h2>
